        <p>
            You might think that to build a great-looking body, you
            need to spend 2-3 hours in a gym 5-6 days a week.
        </p>
        <p>
            You might think that the only way to achieve six-pack
            abs <span class="bold">is to starve, crunch, and repeat.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            You might think that achieving peak physical
            fitness <span class="bold">
                is all about training more and
                dieting hard.
            </span> Wrong.
        </p>
        <p>
            Instead, real change happens when
            you do things <span class="bold">SMARTER</span>.
        </p>
