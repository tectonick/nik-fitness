        <h2 class=""><u>Meet Coach Nik</u></h2>
        <p>Hello, my name is Nik Kurdoyak, and I am a professional fitness and peak performance coach. I represent
            my brand TrainedByNik, and it's my passion to help people build great-looking bodies, become
            high-performance
            machines, and live more powerful lives.</p>

        <p>I've been an athlete my whole life. It all started with a huge passion for hardcore downhill mountain biking,
            which later transitioned into health and fitness. Being in a great physical shape always helped me go
            through hard times, perform better at work, be a better husband, and just live a much happier life. And
            that's why it's my passion now to help others achieve the same. If you look good, feel good and are full of
            energy - you have a higher self-worth, drive, and confidence, all of which will positively impact all other
            areas of your life and even people around you.</p>

        <p>I have a degree in fitness from Niagara College Canada, multiple certifications, and have worked with
            some of the best people in the industry, including the fitness legend Amer "The Hammer" Camra. I worked as
            an
            in-person trainer, in-home trainer, and even as a coach in a drug and alcohol rehab facility. By this point,
            I've already helped hundreds of people build their best bodies and transform their minds.</p>

        <p>And, of course I can't finish my bio without mentioning that I am a huge animal lover :)</p>
