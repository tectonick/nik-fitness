    <div class="text-block">
      <p class="fogged">My name is Nik Kurdoyak, and I am your ultimate fitness and life
        mentor. It is my passion to help people build their best bodies,
        transform their minds, and start living more powerful lives.</p>
      <p class="fogged">Today people tend to neglect their body and health, justifying it with
        having so many work and family commitments, and delaying a healthy
        lifestyle for years and even decades later. However, it works the
        complete opposite way – success in other areas STARTS WITH YOUR HEALTH.
        The better you look and feel – the better you do in your career, family
        life, and everywhere else.</p>
      <p class="fogged">I have a crazy and tough journey behind me. I was born in a rotten
        Siberian town, come from a very rough background, lost my dad when I was
        11, lived in 3 different countries, experienced severe instability, and
        much more. But, the thing that’s NEVER changed in my life was my
        commitment to fitness, and it has always helped me push through hard
        times, keep up my passions, and keep going towards my wildest dreams.
        And I am here to help YOU!</p>

    <h2 class=""><u>Online Coaching and Mentoring</u></h2>
    <div class="text-block">

      <p class="brushed2">The online world is full of fitness programs that provide you with
        training routines, nutrition plans, weekly check-ins, etc. However, many
        people need “soft” things to achieve dramatic and long- lasting changes.</p>
      <p class="brushed1">I take pride in creating the only program of its kind. The program goes
        way beyond just giving you training and nutrition plans. TrainedByNik’s
        program will provide the highest level of thoroughness, root cause
        analysis, and attention to detail. I will also mentor you, educate you,
        and will be right there beside you EVERY SINGLE DAY supporting you.
        People who get on board with me are NOT just my customers, we become
        partners.</p>
      <p class="brushed3">But, there is even more to it than that. At this point, don’t take my
        word for anything else, just follow the link and see it all for yourself
        (including client success stories)</p>
