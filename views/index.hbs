        <h2 class=""><u>It’s time to become a NEW YOU</u></h2>
        <div class="text-block">
            <p>My name is Nik Kurdoyak, and I am your ultimate fitness and life mentor. It is my true passion to
                help people build their best bodies, transform their minds, and improve their health. So they
                become high-performing machines at work and business, great parents and spouses, and just start
                living more powerful lives.</p>
            <p>In today’s world, people tend to neglect their body and health, justifying it with having so many
                work and family commitments, and delaying a healthy lifestyle for years and even decades later
                (when the right time comes). However, it works the complete opposite way – success in other
                areas STARTS WITH YOUR HEALTH. The better you look and feel – the better you do in your career,
                family life, and everywhere else.</p>
            <p>I have a crazy, unique, and tough journey behind me. My life punched me in the face multiple
                times the hard way. I was born in a rotten Siberian town, come from a very rough background,
                lived in 3 different countries (by the age of 27), experienced severe instability, went through
                bankruptcies, and much more. However, the thing that’s NEVER changed in my life was my
                commitment to fitness, and it has always helped me push through hard times, keep up my
                passions, and keep going towards my wildest dreams. And I am here to help YOU!</p>

        <h2 class=""><u>Online Coaching and Mentoring</u></h2>
        <div class="text-block">
            <p>
                The online world is full of fitness programs that provide you with training programs, nutrition
                plans, weekly check-ins, etc. However, many people need “soft” things to achieve dramatic and
                long-lasting changes.</p>
            <p>I take pride in creating the only program of its kind. The program goes way beyond just giving you
                training and nutrition plans. TrainedByNik’s program will provide the highest level of thoroughness,
                root cause analysis, and attention to detail. And, I will not just coach you, but also mentor and
                educate you, provide all kinds of support during the hard times, and do everything I can to inspire
                and motivate you to keep going. People who get on board with me are NOT just my customers, we
                become partners.</p>
            <p>But, there is even more to it than that. At this point, don’t take my word for anything else, just
                follow the link and see it all for yourself (including client success stories)</p>
